# Name Processor

## About

Someone in my church group asked me to create a tool to shuffle names of the group.

Here is the tool I built. This is an online tool to shuffle names.

There are 2 forms. This first one just shuffles the names from a list. The second form splits the names into groups. Shuffling of names can be toggled if needed.
