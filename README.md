# Randomise Names

## About

Someone in my church group asked me to create a tool to randomise names of the group.

Here is the tool I built.

This is an online tool to randomise names.

There are 2 forms. This first one just randomises the names and assigns them to a name on the original list.

The second form randomises the names and puts them into chunks.
